Hello {{ full_name }},

This is an important notification about the data in your eggtimer account.

Until now, eggtimer has been storing all data in Eastern time. As you may already be aware,
this creates issues for users in other timezones. I am going to update the application so all
data is stored in UTC. This may affect your data!

If you are in Eastern time, your data will be migrated correctly, and you need do nothing.

If you have been using eggtimer from another timezone, you have two options:
1) Notify me of your timezone before July 14, 2015 and I will ensure that your data is migrated
correctly.
2) Do nothing, and your data will be migrated as if it is in Eastern time. This will likely
result in a time shift when you view your events. If desired, you can then edit events yourself.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

Sincerely,
{{ admin_name }}
